# Tasks

These are mostly backburner tasks I needed a place for.

## Now
- [ ] Revisit standup (2025-06-24)
- [ ] Start a progress Markdown file (good for getting perspective and documentation, which I like and feel that even the process of writing it is helpful)
- [ ] Test 3 cases with 2.5-Flash and 2.5-Flash-Lite in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)
    - [ ] 2 cases on which Pro succeeded
    - [ ] 1 case on which Pro failed
    - This is to get a sense of how the Gemini series behaves with respect to each other
- [ ] Clone [official project repo](https://github.com/lil-lab/dual-rep)
    - [ ] Move to branch's demo file
- [ ] Ask Claude to get started on Python scripting in Blender, relevant skills to and the triangle map task
- [ ] Generate the triangle map tasks' 2 configurations

## Notes
