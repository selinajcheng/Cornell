# Tasks

These are mostly backburner tasks I needed a place for.

## Now
- [ ] Test 3 cases with 2.5-Flash and 2.5-Flash-Lite in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)
    - [X] 1 case on which Pro succeeded
    - [X] Another case on which Pro succeeded
        - [X] Prompt
        - [X] Read and record observations
    - [ ] 1 case on which Pro failed
        - [X] Prompt
        - [ ] Read and record observations
    - This is to get a sense of how the Gemini series behaves with respect to each other
- [ ] Work on creating the triangle map tasks' 2 configurations
    - [ ] Ask AI to get started on Python scripting in Blender (must-knows)
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you the relevant knowledge needed to draw basic 3D geometric shapes
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 3 walls
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 3 walls that make a triangle
        - [ ] Equilateral
        - [ ] Custom angles (35-60-85)
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 2 walls that form a corner
    - [ ] Then ask for a custom angled corner
    - [ ] Ask AI how to place vertices at specific coordinates
- [ ] Start a progress Markdown file (good for getting perspective and documentation, which I like and feel that even the process of writing it is helpful)
- [ ] Revisit standups

## Notes
- [ ] Transcribe and refine notes for the first 3 papers you read
