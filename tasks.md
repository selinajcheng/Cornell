# Tasks

These are mostly backburner tasks I needed a place for.

## Now
- [ ] Continue working on recreating the triangle map tasks
    - [ ] Adjust hypotenuse so all walls have equal widths
    - [ ] Shrink sides
    - [ ] Corner set up (need 3 more walls)
- [ ] Start a progress Markdown file (good for getting perspective and documentation, which I like and feel that even the process of writing it is helpful)
- [ ] Revisit standups
    - [ ] 2025-06-11
    - [ ] 2025-06-24
    - [ ] 2025-07-01

## Notes
- [ ] Transcribe and refine notes for the first 3 papers you read
    - Maybe reread them while you're at it, especially if you don't remember it well even after reading notes :/

## Archive (shelved by dates done; reverse-chronological)
### 2025-07-01
- [ ] Work on creating the triangle map tasks' 2 configurations
    - [X] Ask AI to get started on Python scripting in Blender (must-knows)
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you the relevant knowledge needed to draw basic 3D geometric shapes
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 3 walls
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 3 walls that make a triangle
        - [ ] Equilateral
        - [ ] Custom angles (35-60-85)
    - [ ] Ask AI to teach you how to draw 2 walls that form a corner
    - [ ] Then ask for a custom angled corner
    - [ ] Ask AI how to place vertices at specific coordinates
Instead of AI, I ended up learning much of this through [Geometry, colors and materials - Introduction to Scientific Visualization with Blender](https://surf-visualization.github.io/blender-course/advanced/python_scripting/3_geometry_colors_and_materials/) and experimenting using the base code from there. This is obviously the more "old-fashioned" way and while it may have been more efficient to ask genAI, I believe the code I have as a result of *not* doing that is more clean, which is just as valuable.

### 2025-06-26
- [ ] Test 3 cases with 2.5-Flash and 2.5-Flash-Lite in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)
    - [X] 1 case on which Pro succeeded
    - [X] Another case on which Pro succeeded
        - [X] Prompt
        - [X] Read and record observations
    - [ ] 1 case on which Pro failed
        - [X] Prompt
        - [ ] Read and record observations
    - This is to get a sense of how the Gemini series behaves with respect to each other

### 2025-06-25
- [X] Clone [official project repo](https://github.com/lil-lab/dual-rep)
    - [X] Move to branch's demo file

### Unknown
- [X] Number the notebook
